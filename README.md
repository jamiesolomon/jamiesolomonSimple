# Jamie Solomon - Data Science Projects

## Project 1: [Foreign Exchange Normality Analysis and Modeling](https://github.com/jamiesolomon/ForeignExchangeNormality)
 + EDA
    - Mainly focused on the EDA of the foreign exchange pairing USD/CAD
    - Proof supporting the hypothosis: The USD/CAD foreign exchange rate follows a normal distribution when seperated into longterm periods of time.
    - These periods of time is what "Periodic Normality" refers to in the project report
        - The periods of normality indicated in this report are: [June 2006 - Nov 2014) amd [Nov 2014 - Dec 2021]
        - This notion helps machine learning algoriythms assess the risk associated with a specific rate extreamly efficently strictly using technical analysis.
